Fundamentals of Software Design and Development 
Winter 2020, January 6 2020 - April 24 2020

Detailed Description

Students gain experience working with Object-Oriented source code and the Unified Modelling Language (UML) to design and implement new features using best practices of Object-Oriented Design. This learning is supported by exploring techniques to test and maintain software. Working in groups, students apply their learning in a practical project. Students are also responsible for testing and managing the project source code.


Critical Performance:
By the end of this course students will have demonstrated the ability to extend a multi-tiered software application using object-oriented Design (OOD) approach and the Unified Modelling Language (UML).
 	
Learning Outcomes:

To achieve critical performance, students will have demonstrated the ability to:

To evaluate different software design methodologies by exploring their use, strengths and limitations.
Explain abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism and how they contribute to maintainable, reusable programming code.
Extend the requirements fulfilled by a software application using a design class model and a software modelling tool.
Extend given source code to implement object-oriented design principles.
Model software objects and their relationships to each other using a UML Design Class Diagram and a software modelling tool.
Validate the application using systematic tests to verify it against its documented design requirements.
Refactor programming code using a UML class diagram and a software modelling tool to implement the high-level principles of object-oriented design.
Identify fundamental object-oriented design patterns and principles through the analysis of software design and code.
Apply fundamental source control techniques using a configuration management tool.
