Object Oriented Programming, Winter 2020, January 6 2020 - April 24 2020

This course extends the concepts of object-oriented programming introduced in the preceding course. The student will be exposed to topics, including exception handling, inheritance, advance class building concepts, Arrays and array lists plus GUI programming. These topics will expand the knowledge base of the student and prepare the student for the subsequent courses in the program. In addition to the technical skills involved, students will gradually be expected to take on more of the responsibility for coming up with the design and the solution required to solve a problem. Students will thus be exposed to the critical thinking skills required to take a problem, analyze the problem, then come up with a program to solve the problem.

By the end of this course, students will have demonstrated the ability to Write robust applications using Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and various GUI components. Write applications that store and retrieve data to/from sequential data files. Write applications that make use of error-trapping and data validation techniques. Write applications that include arrays and Array Lists. Plan, design and develop a small application that makes use of all the elements learned in the course.
